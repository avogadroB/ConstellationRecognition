# Constellation Recognition

## Problem Statement: 
Design and implement a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying all constellations present within the challenge images ("challenge1" and "challenge2"). The model should be trained on the provided training data and evaluated on its ability to classify constellations in the unseen test set images.

## Algorithm: 
Classifying constellations based on images and corresponding labels from a mapper CSV file, we employed a Multi-label Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classification algorithm.
Using CNNs for itâ€™s ability to automatically learn hierarchical features directly from raw pixel data, enabling accurate classification of constellations based on subtle visual cues.
